\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Molecular Dynamics run of aniline in 32 explicit solvating water molecules. Notice that in thermal equilibrium, aniline molecule lies outside of the water sphere. Albeit hydrogen bond being clearly established, lack of total submersion in water means 32-water does not fully solvate the aniline molecule and suggests that 64-water will give more accurate results. (a) starting geometry of MD run created by packmol (b) geometry after 15000 fs. Notice the hydrogen bond between the amino group and water cluster. (c) geometry after 25000 fs. The amino group is pointing in the water sphere, as it continues to through out the whole MD run. (d) A plot of potential Energy of the system vs time. At 15000 fs, equilibrium starts as evident by decrease in energy fluctuation.\relax }}{6}
