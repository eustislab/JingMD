	abstract = {Using LR-TDDFT, we calculated the 0−0 energies of 15 small radicals for which the experimental values in gas phase are available. We used 17 functionals. It turned out that B3LYP, M06-2X, $\omega$B97X-D, CAM-B3LYP, and HSE06 functionals are the most effective functionals in terms of root-mean-square and average unsigned deviation. Using the standard value (0.47 a−0 1) of the attenuation parameter $\omega$, the long-range-corrected LC-GGA functionals give poor results. However, the LC-PBE with $\omega$ = 0.25 a−0 1 give a performance similar to that of B3LYP. Taking into account zero-point correction improves the results, but the contribution of adiabatic correction is more important than that due to the vibration. The vertical approximation is certainly not recommended. An adiabatic calculation seems to give a good compromise between computing time (and resources) and reliability of the results for most of molecules investigated in this work.},

	abstract = {An approach is developed to obtain statistical properties similar to those of an infinite bulk system from computer simulations of a finite cluster. A rigorous theoretical formulation is given for the solvent boundary potential which takes the influence of the surrounding bulk into account. The solvent boundary potential is the configuration‐dependent solvation free energy of an effective cluster composed of an arbitrary solute and a finite number of explicit solvent molecules embedded inside a hard sphere of variable radius; the hard sphere does not act directly on the solute or the explicit solvent molecules, and its radius varies according to the instantaneous configurations. The formulation follows from an exact separation of the multidimensional configurational Boltzmann integral in terms of the solvent molecules nearest to the solute and the remaining bulk solvent molecules. An approximation to the solvent boundary potential is constructed for simulations of bulk water at constant pressure, including the influence of van der Waals and electrostaticinteractions. The approximation is illustrated with calculations of the solvation free energy of a water molecule and of sodium and potassiumions. The influence of bulk solvent on the conformational equilibrium of molecular solutes is illustrated by performing umbrella sampling calculations of n‐butane and alanine dipeptide in water. The boundary potential is tested to examine the dependence of the results on the number of water molecules included explicitly in the simulations. It is observed that bulk‐like results are obtained, even when only the waters in the first hydration shell are included explicitly.},

In TDDFT, the appearance of spurious charge-transfer states below the first optical excited state is shown to have significant effects on the predicted absorption and emission spectra of several donor−acceptor substituted molecules. The same problem affects the predictions of electronic spectra of molecular aggregates formed from weakly interacting chromophores. For selected benchmark cases, we show that today's popular density functionals, such as purely local (Local Density Approximation, LDA) and semilocal (Generalized Gradient Approximation, GGA) models, are qualitatively wrong. Nonlocal hybrid approximations including both semiempirical (B3LYP) and ab initio (PBE1PBE) containing a small fraction (20−25{\%}) of Fock-like orbital exchange are also susceptible to such problems. Functionals that contain a larger fraction (50{\%}) of orbital exchange like the early hybrid (BHandHLYP) are shown to exhibit far fewer spurious charge-transfer (CT) states at the expense of accuracy. Based on the trends observed in this study and our previous experience we formulate several practical approaches to overcome these difficulties providing a reliable description of electronic excitations in nanosystems.},

The Landau-Zener model was implemented with an Arrhenius type rate equation to determine relative intersystem crossing (ISC) and internal conversion (IC) rates. Preliminary calculations using this approach considering only the S0, S1 and T1 states gave estimates of TQY at 0.56 for aniline (experimental: 0.9)2 and 1.00 for benzene (experimental 0.15).2 Although this estimate for aniline was deemed within acceptable range for predictive purposes, the estimate for benzene incorrectly estimated IC rate to be negligible relative to ISC rate. Due to long calculation times for the calculations required for the Landau- Zener model, as well as its unreliable predictions in this implementation, a second method was pursued using Fermi’s Golden Rule (FGR). TQY predictions were not obtained for the test molecules with the FGR method due to insufficient memory and computational speed to handle all of the Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) involved in the calculation. Recursive selection criteria were implemented for removing negligible FCFs, but the criteria implemented were insufficient for properly eliminating terms, and it was determined that more sophisticated selection criteria were necessary for effective implementation of FGR in this application.},

A detailed breakdown of the physical effects in the QM/MM model indicates that hydrogen-bonding effects are mainly responsible for the differences in computed values of E-0 between the QM/MM and implicit models. Our results highlight the importance of including solute-solvent hydrogen-bonding effects in the theoretical modeling of redox processes.},

	abstract = {The effect of basis sets on MP2 and CCSD calculated geometries has been investigated for a series of small organic molecules with two to four nonhydrogen atoms. Whereas 6-311++G** usually leads to satisfactory structures, this was not true with aug-cc-pVDZ, although it uses more basis functions than the former set. In addition, the smaller 6-311++G** invariably leads to lower calculated energies than aug-cc-pVDZ. With a given basis set, CCSD gives more satisfactory calculated geometries than MP2, but with a much greater computation time. For the compounds in this report, B3LYP/6-311++G** is quite effective in giving satisfactory calculated geometries at a relatively small computational cost.},

	abstract = {A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) type of scheme is employed to calculate the solvent-induced shifts of molecular electronic excitations. The effective fragment potential (EFP) method was used for the classical potential. Since EFP has a density dependent functional form, in contrast with most other MM potentials, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has been modified to combine TDDFT with EFP. This new method is then used to perform a hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation to generate a simulated spectrum of the n-->pi(*) vertical excitation energy of acetone in vacuum and with 100 water molecules. The calculated water solvent effect on the vertical excitation energy exhibits a blueshift of the n-->pi(*) vertical excitation energy in acetone (Delta omega(1)=0.211 eV), which is in good agreement with the experimental blueshift.},

@article{Zhan2003,
	abstract = {Representative atomic and molecular systems, including various inorganic and organic molecules with covalent and ionic bonds, have been studied by using density functional theory. The calculations were done with the commonly used exchange-correlation functional B3LYP followed by a comprehensive analysis of the calculated highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied Kohn - Sham orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energies. The basis set dependence of the DFT results shows that the economical 6-31 +G* basis set is generally sufficient for calculating the HOMO and LUMO energies (if the calculated LUMO energies are negative) for use in correlating with molecular properties. The directly calculated ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), electronegativity ({\o}), hardness ({\`{e}}), and first electron excitation energy ({\^{o}}) are all in good agreement with the available experimental data. A generally applicable linear correlation relationship exists between the calculated HOMO energies and the experimental/calculated IPs. We have also found satisfactory linear correlation relationships between the calculated LUMO energies and experimental/calculated EAs (for the bound anionic states), between the calculated average HOMO/LUMO energies and {\o} values, between the calculated HOMO - LUMO energy gaps and {\`{e}} values, and between the calculated HOMO - LUMO energy gaps and experimental/ calculated first excitation energies. By using these linear correlation relationships, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energies can be employed to semiquantitatively estimate ionization potential, electron affinity, electronegativity, hardness, and first excitation energy.},
