	abstract = {Using LR-TDDFT, we calculated the 0−0 energies of 15 small radicals for which the experimental values in gas phase are available. We used 17 functionals. It turned out that B3LYP, M06-2X, $\omega$B97X-D, CAM-B3LYP, and HSE06 functionals are the most effective functionals in terms of root-mean-square and average unsigned deviation. Using the standard value (0.47 a−0 1) of the attenuation parameter $\omega$, the long-range-corrected LC-GGA functionals give poor results. However, the LC-PBE with $\omega$ = 0.25 a−0 1 give a performance similar to that of B3LYP. Taking into account zero-point correction improves the results, but the contribution of adiabatic correction is more important than that due to the vibration. The vertical approximation is certainly not recommended. An adiabatic calculation seems to give a good compromise between computing time (and resources) and reliability of the results for most of molecules investigated in this work.},

	abstract = {Representative atomic and molecular systems, including various inorganic and organic molecules with covalent and ionic bonds, have been studied by using density functional theory. The calculations were done with the commonly used exchange-correlation functional B3LYP followed by a comprehensive analysis of the calculated highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied Kohn - Sham orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energies. The basis set dependence of the DFT results shows that the economical 6-31 +G* basis set is generally sufficient for calculating the HOMO and LUMO energies (if the calculated LUMO energies are negative) for use in correlating with molecular properties. The directly calculated ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), electronegativity ({\o}), hardness ({\`{e}}), and first electron excitation energy ({\^{o}}) are all in good agreement with the available experimental data. A generally applicable linear correlation relationship exists between the calculated HOMO energies and the experimental/calculated IPs. We have also found satisfactory linear correlation relationships between the calculated LUMO energies and experimental/calculated EAs (for the bound anionic states), between the calculated average HOMO/LUMO energies and {\o} values, between the calculated HOMO - LUMO energy gaps and {\`{e}} values, and between the calculated HOMO - LUMO energy gaps and experimental/ calculated first excitation energies. By using these linear correlation relationships, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energies can be employed to semiquantitatively estimate ionization potential, electron affinity, electronegativity, hardness, and first excitation energy.},

Using the QM/MM model, we calculated one-electron E-0 values for several aqueous transition-metal complexes and found substantially improved agreement with experiment compared to values obtained from implicit solvent models.

	abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a powerful tool allowing for accurate description of excited states in many nanoscale molecular systems; however, its application to large molecules may be plagued with difficulties that are not immediately obvious from previous experiences of applying TDDFT to small molecules. In TDDFT, the appearance of spurious charge-transfer states below the first optical excited state is shown to have significant effects on the predicted absorption and emission spectra of several donor−acceptor substituted molecules. The same problem affects the predictions of electronic spectra of molecular aggregates formed from weakly interacting chromophores. For selected benchmark cases, we show that today's popular density functionals, such as purely local (Local Density Approximation, LDA) and semilocal (Generalized Gradient Approximation, GGA) models, are qualitatively wrong. Nonlocal hybrid approximations including both semiempirical (B3LYP) and ab initio (PBE1PBE) containing a small fraction (20−25{\%}) of Fock-like orbital exchange are also susceptible to such problems. Functionals that contain a larger fraction (50{\%}) of orbital exchange like the early hybrid (BHandHLYP) are shown to exhibit far fewer spurious charge-transfer (CT) states at the expense of accuracy. Based on the trends observed in this study and our previous experience we formulate several practical approaches to overcome these difficulties providing a reliable description of electronic excitations in nanosystems.},

The Landau-Zener model was implemented with an Arrhenius type rate equation to determine relative intersystem crossing (ISC) and internal conversion (IC) rates. Preliminary calculations using this approach considering only the S0, S1 and T1 states gave estimates of TQY at 0.56 for aniline (experimental: 0.9)2 and 1.00 for benzene (experimental 0.15).2 Although this estimate for aniline was deemed within acceptable range for predictive purposes, the estimate for benzene incorrectly estimated IC rate to be negligible relative to ISC rate. Due to long calculation times for the calculations required for the Landau- Zener model, as well as its unreliable predictions in this implementation, a second method was pursued using Fermi’s Golden Rule (FGR). TQY predictions were not obtained for the test molecules with the FGR method due to insufficient memory and computational speed to handle all of the Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) involved in the calculation. Recursive selection criteria were implemented for removing negligible FCFs, but the criteria implemented were insufficient for properly eliminating terms, and it was determined that more sophisticated selection criteria were necessary for effective implementation of FGR in this application.},

	abstract = {An approach is developed to obtain statistical properties similar to those of an infinite bulk system from computer simulations of a finite cluster. A rigorous theoretical formulation is given for the solvent boundary potential which takes the influence of the surrounding bulk into account. The solvent boundary potential is the configuration‐dependent solvation free energy of an effective cluster composed of an arbitrary solute and a finite number of explicit solvent molecules embedded inside a hard sphere of variable radius; the hard sphere does not act directly on the solute or the explicit solvent molecules, and its radius varies according to the instantaneous configurations. The formulation follows from an exact separation of the multidimensional configurational Boltzmann integral in terms of the solvent molecules nearest to the solute and the remaining bulk solvent molecules. An approximation to the solvent boundary potential is constructed for simulations of bulk water at constant pressure, including the influence of van der Waals and electrostaticinteractions. The approximation is illustrated with calculations of the solvation free energy of a water molecule and of sodium and potassiumions. The influence of bulk solvent on the conformational equilibrium of molecular solutes is illustrated by performing umbrella sampling calculations of n‐butane and alanine dipeptide in water. The boundary potential is tested to examine the dependence of the results on the number of water molecules included explicitly in the simulations. It is observed that bulk‐like results are obtained, even when only the waters in the first hydration shell are included explicitly.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of aniline in aqueous infinitely dilute solution are performed from ambient to supercritical conditions. Spatial hydration structures of aniline are examined along the liquid branch of the liquid-vapor coexistence curve of the simple point charge/extended water model at 298, 373, 473, and 573 K and in the supercritical region at 633, 733, and 833 K with density fixed at 0.3 g/cm(3). The coordination and H-bond numbers of aniline are calculated. The self-diffusion coefficient of aniline is also evaluated. At room temperature the solvation shell of aniline is comprised of approximately 32 water molecules. At 298 K, the amino group is hydrated by three water molecules with which it forms one strong and two weak (0.6) H bonds acting as an acceptor and donor, respectively. In addition, approximately 1.5 water molecules are identified as pi-coordinated, forming close to 0.75 H bonds with the aromatic ring of aniline. The features of the hydration shell structure of aniline diminish with temperature and decreasing density. The disappearance of pi-coordinated water molecules is noted at around 473 K, whereas the loss of the hydrophobic solvent cage is observed near the critical point of water. At supercritical conditions aniline is hydrated by approximately eight water molecules with the amino group coordinated to roughly two of them, forming less than one H bond in total.},

	abstract = {Prescription and nonprescription drugs were detected in rivers and streams in Europe and the United States. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are an important source of these contaminants, but few data exist on the spatial distribution of drugs in surface waters near STPs. Samples of surface water were collected in the summer and fall of 2000 at open-water sites in the lower Great Lakes (Lake Ontario and Lake Erie), at sites near the 2 STPs for the city of Windsor (ON, Canada), and at sites in Hamilton Harbor (ON, Canada), an embayment of western Lake Ontario that receives discharges from several STPs. In a follow-up study in the summer of 2002, samples of surface water and final effluent from adjacent STPs were collected from sites in Hamilton Harbor and Windsor. In addn., surface water and STP effluent samples were collected in Peterborough (ON, Canada). All samples of surface water and STP effluents were analyzed for selected acidic and neutral drugs. In the survey of Hamilton Harbor and Windsor conducted in 2000, acidic drugs and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were detected at ng/L concns. at sites that were up to 500 m away from the STP, but the hydrol. conditions of the receiving waters strongly influenced the spatial distribution of these compds. Drugs were not detected at open-water locations in western Lake Erie or in the Niagara River near the municipality of Niagara-on-the-Lake (ON, Canada). However, clofibric acid, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, and carbamazepine were detected in samples collected in the summer of 2000 at sites in Lake Ontario and at a site in the Niagara River (Fort Erie, ON, Canada) that were relatively remote from STP discharges. Follow-up studies in the summer of 2002 indicated that concns. of acidic and neutral drugs in surface waters near the point of sewage discharge into the Little River (ON, Canada) STP were approx. equal to the concns. in the final effluent from the STP. Caffeine and cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, were generally present in STP effluents and surface waters contaminated by drugs. The antidepressant fluoxetine and the antibiotic trimethoprom were also detected in most STP effluents and some surface water samples. For the first time, the lipid regulating drug atorvastatin was detected in samples of STP effluent and surface water. [on SciFinder(R)]},

	abstract = {This study discusses the occurrence and environmental risk associated with a micropollutant plume originating from the direct discharge of treated wastewater into the Vidy Bay of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. The temporal variations and spatial extent of the plume and its effect on the presence of 39 pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants in the Vidy Bay were assessed over a 10 month period. A pronounced plume was observed from April to October, leading to locally elevated (up to 70-fold) pharmaceutical concentrations compared to the surrounding water column. For three of the measured substances, these plume-associated concentrations were sufficiently high to pose an ecotoxicological risk. The plume depth followed the thermal lake stratification, which moved to lower depths over the course of the warm seasons. Pharmaceutical hotspots associated with the plume were detected as far as 1.5 km downstream of the effluent wastewater outfall, but concentrations typically decreased with increasing distance from the wastewater outfall as a result of dilution and photodegradation. From November to January, when uniform temperature prevailed throughout the water column, no micropollutant plumes were detected. In contrast to pharmaceuticals, most pesticides showed homogeneous concentrations throughout the Vidy Bay during the whole study period, indicating that the effluent wastewater was not their dominant source. A strong linear correlation between electrical conductivity and concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants was identified. This relation will allow future estimates of wastewater-derived micropollutant concentrations via simple conductivity measurements.},

In order to det. spatial and temporal variations in concns. of pharmaceuticals in the Tennessee River, water samples were collected from multiple points along the river and at the inflow of major tributaries.  Sampling structure was designed to study trends between surface and subsurface samples, seasonal trends (winter, spring, summer, and fall), the direct effect of sewage treatment plants (upstream vs. downstream), and the effect of downstream distance on pharmaceutical concns.  All samples were quantified via solid phase extn. followed by liq. chromatog.-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  This method yielded reproducible quantitation at low parts per trillion (ng/L) levels for all 14 analytes (acetaminophen, atorvastatin, caffeine, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, fluoxetine, levofloxacin, lovastatin, norfluoxetine, ranitidine, sertraline, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim).  Correlation analyses (depth, distance) and repeated-measures ANOVAs (season, sewage treatment plant proximity) were used to det. statistically significant trends for frequently detected pharmaceuticals (caffeine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole).  Caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were found to vary by season in subsurface samples; spring exhibited the highest concns.  Carbamazepine varied in proximity to sewage treatment plant outfall with subsurface samples yielding greater concns. downstream than upstream.

Methods From Dec. 2007 to Dec. 2008, water samples were collected monthly (n = 12) from an upstream point, the effluent, four downstream points of the WWTP, and at the point where the river merges with the lake, and the concns. of ibuprofen, naproxen, bezafibrate, diclofenac, and ketoprofen were detd.  The anal. methodol. involved solid-phase extn. of the target compds. from water samples followed by liq. chromatog. coupled with tandem mass spectrometry for compd. sepn. and detection.  Results The studied pharmaceuticals were found in the effluent at concns. ranging from 31 to 1,852 ng l-1 depending on the season.  In the river and lake, the concns. were much lower (6-400 ng l-1) mainly due to diln. but also to a season-dependent contribution from natural transformation processes.  The mean mass flow of all analgesics was highest during winter while the highest mean mass flow of the lipid regulator bezafibrate was obsd. in spring.  Conclusions The WWTP is the main source of the target compds. in the aquatic environment.  The obsd. winter accumulation signifies the importance of natural transformation processes, which can only be estd. based on mass flow data, on the fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment.

Direct phototransformation of the anionic form with a quantum yield of 0.31 (laboratory conditions at 313 nm) was identified as the dominant photochemical degradation pathway of triclosan. Combining the photochemical parameters with actual meteorological data and field measurements allowed us to validate a model describing the behavior of triclosan in the water column of a Swiss lake (Lake Greifensee).

Traditional practice in simulation data analysis recommends this initial portion be discarded to equilibration, but no simple, general, and automated procedure for this process exists. Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest, in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure, and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data.},

It is in fact well-known that molecular responses and processes are strongly affected or, in some cases, completely determined by the surrounding environment (either a solvent, a protein, a membrane, a polymer, or a composite matrix). This Perspective highlights recent achievements and suggests possible future developments of one of the most popular approaches to include environmental effects in molecular calculations, the continuun solvation model.},

We calculate ground-state atomization energies, reaction barriers, ionization energies, and electron affinities, each as a function of the range-separation parameter mu. In addition, we calculate excitation energies of small- and medium-sized molecules, again as a function of mu, by applying the LRC to time-dependent density functional theory. Representative examples of both pure and hybrid density functionals are tested. On the basis of these results, there does not appear to be a single range-separation parameter that is reasonable for both ground-state properties and vertical excitation energies. Reasonable errors in atomization energies and barrier heights are achieved only at the expense of excessively high excitation energies, at least for the medium-sized molecules, whereas values of mu that afford reasonable excitation energies yield some of the largest errors for ground-state atomization energies and barrier heights in small molecules. Notably, this conclusion is obscured if the database of excitation energies includes only small molecules, as has been the case in previous benchmark studies of LRC functionals.},

	abstract = {Controversy remains regarding the suitable density functionals for the calculation of vitamin B(12) systems that contain cobalt. To identify the optimum functionals, geometry optimization calculations were performed on a full-size model of methylcobalamin (MeCbl) using the B3LYP, B3LYP-D, BP86, and BP86-D methods in conjunction with the 6-31G* basis set. Single-point energy evaluations were also performed with the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set. Consistent with previous studies, the BP86-optimized geometry showed fairly good agreement with the experimental geometry. Various factors that may influence the homolytic bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the Co-C bond of MeCbl were systematically evaluated with these methods. Our analysis demonstrated that dispersion was the largest correction term that influenced the magnitude of BDE. Previous studies have shown that B3LYP significantly underestimates BDE, whereas BP86 gives BDE values that are fairly close to the experimental values (36-37 kcal/mol). The same trend in the relative magnitudes of the BDEs was observed in the present calculations. However, BP86 underestimated the BDE for a full model of MeCbl. When the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange in the B3LYP functional was reduced to 15{\%} and the dispersion correction was made (i.e., B3LYP*-D), the calculated BDE was in good accord with experimental values. B3P86-D also performed well. A detailed analysis was undertaken to determine which atoms in cobalamin have large dispersion interactions with a methyl fragment of MeCbl.},

	abstract = {The vertical singlet-singlet excitation energies for a benchmark set of 14 medium and large molecules have been investigated with three quantum chemical methods. Calculations for electronic states with very different character in organic and inorganic systems are used to assess the accuracy and applicability of a simplified multireference M{\o}ller-Plesset (MR-MP2) approach, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and an approximate coupled cluster method with single and double excitations (CC2). In the pure ab initio approaches the resolution of the identity (RI) method for the calculation of the two-electron integrals is used to improve computational efficiency. It is shown that independently of the complexity of the electronic states involved, only the MR-MP2 method yields high accuracy (mean absolute deviation of 0.14 eV for 22 states). This finding is of particular importance because our scheme avoids computationally demanding orbital optimization steps and employs very compact reference wave functions. The TDDFT results are significantly poorer (mean absolute deviation of 0.26 eV), and systematic deviations for some $\pi$→$\pi$* states, Rydberg states, and systems with unusual electronic structure are obtained. It is concluded that TDDFT has a potential for exploratory investigations or for very large molecules due to its computational efficiency. The CC2 method shows a tendency to overestimate excitation energies and is also limited to systems where the ground state is well described by a single determinant.},

Next, we chose random solute structures from this simulation and performed classical MD simulation for each chosen solute structure with its geometry fixed. This new scheme allowed us to sample the solute molecule quantum mechanically and sample many solvent structures classically. Excitation energy calculations using the selected samples were carried out by the generalized multiconfigurational perturbation theory. We succeeded in constructing the absorption spectra and realizing the red shift of the absorption spectra found in polar solvents. To understand the motion of C120 in water, we carried out principal component analysis and found that the motion of the methyl group made the largest contribution and the motion of the amino group the second largest. The solvent effect on the absorption spectrum was studied by decomposing it in two components: the effect from the distortion of the solute molecule and the field effect from the solvent molecules. The solvent effect from the solvent molecules shows large contribution to the solvent shift of the peak of the absorption spectrum, while the solvent effect from the solute molecule shows no contribution. The solvent effect from the solute molecule mainly contributes to the broadening of the absorption spectrum. In the solvent effect, the variation in C-C bond length has the largest contribution on the absorption spectrum from the solute molecule. For the solvent effect on the absorption spectrum from the solvent molecules, the solvent structure around the amino group of C120 plays the key role.},

The theory represents the solvent response as a combination of the density and polarization fluctuations of the solvent given in terms of the density and polarization structure factors. A fully analytical formulation of the theory is provided for a solute of arbitrary shape with an arbitrary distribution of charge. A good agreement between the analytical procedure and the results of Monte Carlo simulations of model systems is achieved. The reorganization energy splits into the contributions from density fluctuations and polarization fluctuations. The polarization part is dominated by longitudinal polarization response. The density part is inversely proportional to temperature. The dependence of the solvent reorganization energy on the solvent dipole moment and refractive index is discussed.},

This mol. has been studied for many years from different points of interest with both exptl. and theor. methods.  In this study, the RHF /CI Single (RHF/CIS), Time-Dependent D. Functional Theory (TDDFT), and several semi-empirical methods (CNDO/S. and ZINDO) calcns. were carried out to reconstruct the UV-Vis absorption spectra of chlorophyll a.  To some extent, the calcn. results based on the single-mol. approach succeeded to reconstruct the absorption spectra, but they required to be rescaled to fit the exptl. results.  In general, the semi-empirical methods provide a better energy scaling factor.  However, they lack vertical transition fine features with respect to the spectrum obtained exptl.  In this case, the ab initio calcns. provided more complete features, esp. the TDDFT with high-level basis sets, which also has a good accuracy with regards to the transition energies.  The contribution of the ground state and excited state orbitals in the main vertical transitions is discussed based on the delocalized nature of the wave functions and the presence of solvents using the polarizable continuum model (PCM).

These different methods are used to obtain single, double, and quadruple excitation contributions to the correlation energy for a series of molecules including CO,, HCN, N,. CO, BH3, and NH3. It is demonstrated that the sum of double and quadruple excitation diagrams through fourth-order perturbation theory is usually quite close to the CPMET result for these molecules at equilibrium geometries. The superior reliability of the CPMET model as a function of internuclear separation is illustrated by studying the ‘Xipotential curve of Be,. This molecule violates the assumption common to nondegenerate perturbation theory that only a single reference function is important and this causes improper behavior of the potential curve as a function of R.

Recently, Alml{\"{o}}f, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml{\"{o}}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99{\%} of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50{\%} more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94{\%}–97{\%} of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

For aperiodic systems the exact electrostatic energy functional in periodic boundary conditions is obtained. The convergence in such systems is considered in the limit of large supercells, where, in the gas phase, the computational effort is proportional to the volume. It is shown that for neutral localized aperiodic systems in either the gas or condensed phases, the energy can always be made to converge as O(L-5<math><mrow><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">L<mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">-<mn>5) where L is the linear dimension of the supercell.

DFT is less computationally demanding than other computational methods with a similar accuracy, being able to include electron correlation in the calculations at a fraction of time of post-Hartree-Fock methodologies. In this review we provide a brief outline of the density functional theory and of the historic development of the field, focusing later on the several types of density functionals currently available, and finishing with a detailed analysis of the performance of DFT across a wide range of chemical properties and system types, reviewed from the most recent benchmarking studies, which encompass several well-established density functionals together with the most recent efforts in the field. Globally, an overall picture of the level of performance of the plethora of currently available density functionals for each chemical property is drawn, with particular attention being dedicated to the relative performance of the popular B3LYP density functional.},

@article{Baerends1997,
	abstract = {A comparison is made between traditional quantum chemical approaches to the electron correlation problem and the one taken in density functional theory (DFT). Well-known concepts of DFT, such as the exchange-correlation energy E-xc = integral rho(r) epsilon(xc)(r) dr and the exchange-correlation potential upsilon(xc)(r) are related to electron correlation as described in terms of density matrices and the conditional amplitude (Fermi and Coulomb holes). The Kohn-Sham one-electron or orbital model of DFT is contrasted with Hartree-Fock, and the definitions of exchange and correlation in DFT are compared with the traditional ones. The exchange-correlation energy density epsilon(xc)(r) is decomposed into kinetic and electron-electron potential energy components, and a practical way of calculating these from accurate wave functions is discussed, which offers a route to systematic improvement. upsilon(xc)(r) is likewise decomposed, and special features (bond midpoint peak, various types of step behavior) are identified and related to electronic correlation.},

	abstract = {To define the scope and limitations of the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method, spectral absorption data of a series of about 100 neutral or charged sulfur-organic compounds with up to 24 non-hydrogen atoms and up to four sulfur atoms were calculated in the near-UV, visible and IR regions. although the theoretical vertical transition energies correspond only approximately to experimental absorption band maxima, the mean absolute deviation was calculated to be 0.21 eV (1600 cm(-1)). The main absorption features of various compounds with monocoordinated or dicoordinated sulfur atoms are well reproduced. As far as possible TDDFT results were compared with those of semiempirical Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap (ZINDO/S) and of Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) calculations. TDDFT also works well in cases where the semiempirical methods fail. Limitations of TDDFT were encountered with calculations of spectral absorptions of dye molecules. The ``vinylene shift'' of polymethine dyes is not reproduced by TDDFT. Whereas electronic excitation energies delocalized polar and betainic chromophores are reasonably well reproduced, excitation energies of charge-transfer-type and charge-resonance-type transitions of weakly interacting composite chromophores are significantly underestimated.},

	abstract = {We present a method to evaluate absorption energies of a solvated molecule described through a semiempirical wave function. In particular, this paper extends the polarizable continuum model (PCM), in the formulation of the integral equation formalism (IEF), to the ZINDO semiempirical method. The level of theory for the interpretation of the electronic spectra is the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), using the Hartree-Fock state as reference state. Three different formulas are introduced to calculate the solute-solvent interaction potential. The most relevant formal aspects of the theory are discussed and numerical applications to the study of the transitions from the ground state to the first electronic excited state of some coumarins, of a pyridiniophenoxide betaine molecule, and of the methylene blue dye are presented.},
