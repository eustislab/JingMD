	abstract = {We present a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) explicit solvent model for the computation of standard reduction potentials E-0. The QM/MM model uses density functional theory (DFT) to model the solute and a polarizable molecular mechanics (MM) force field to describe the solvent. The linear response approximation is applied to estimate E-0 from the thermally averaged electron attachment/detachment energies computed in the oxidized and reduced states. Using the QM/MM model, we calculated one-electron E-0 values for several aqueous transition-metal complexes and found substantially improved agreement with experiment compared to values obtained from implicit solvent models. A detailed breakdown of the physical effects in the QM/MM model indicates that hydrogen-bonding effects are mainly responsible for the differences in computed values of E-0 between the QM/MM and implicit models. Our results highlight the importance of including solute-solvent hydrogen-bonding effects in the theoretical modeling of redox processes.},

	abstract = {In order to aid in the development of computational methods to guide environmental chemistry, methods for estimating triplet quantum yield (TQY) were applied to 3 test molecules: benzene, aniline and acetophenone. The Landau-Zener model was implemented with an Arrhenius type rate equation to determine relative intersystem crossing (ISC) and internal conversion (IC) rates. Preliminary calculations using this approach considering only the S0, S1 and T1 states gave estimates of TQY at 0.56 for aniline (experimental: 0.9)2 and 1.00 for benzene (experimental 0.15).2 Although this estimate for aniline was deemed within acceptable range for predictive purposes, the estimate for benzene incorrectly estimated IC rate to be negligible relative to ISC rate. Due to long calculation times for the calculations required for the Landau- Zener model, as well as its unreliable predictions in this implementation, a second method was pursued using Fermi’s Golden Rule (FGR). TQY predictions were not obtained for the test molecules with the FGR method due to insufficient memory and computational speed to handle all of the Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) involved in the calculation. Recursive selection criteria were implemented for removing negligible FCFs, but the criteria implemented were insufficient for properly eliminating terms, and it was determined that more sophisticated selection criteria were necessary for effective implementation of FGR in this application.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a powerful tool allowing for accurate description of excited states in many nanoscale molecular systems; however, its application to large molecules may be plagued with difficulties that are not immediately obvious from previous experiences of applying TDDFT to small molecules. In TDDFT, the appearance of spurious charge-transfer states below the first optical excited state is shown to have significant effects on the predicted absorption and emission spectra of several donor−acceptor substituted molecules. The same problem affects the predictions of electronic spectra of molecular aggregates formed from weakly interacting chromophores. For selected benchmark cases, we show that today's popular density functionals, such as purely local (Local Density Approximation, LDA) and semilocal (Generalized Gradient Approximation, GGA) models, are qualitatively wrong. Nonlocal hybrid approximations including both semiempirical (B3LYP) and ab initio (PBE1PBE) containing a small fraction (20−25{\%}) of Fock-like orbital exchange are also susceptible to such problems. Functionals that contain a larger fraction (50{\%}) of orbital exchange like the early hybrid (BHandHLYP) are shown to exhibit far fewer spurious charge-transfer (CT) states at the expense of accuracy. Based on the trends observed in this study and our previous experience we formulate several practical approaches to overcome these difficulties providing a reliable description of electronic excitations in nanosystems.},

Overall, DFT-D(EFP) performs similarly to the semiempirical DFT-D corrections for the test cases investigated in this work. HF-D(EFP) tends to underestimate binding energies and overestimate intermolecular equilibrium distances, relative to coupled cluster theory, most likely due to incomplete accounting for electron correlation.

Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are an important source of these contaminants, but few data exist on the spatial distribution of drugs in surface waters near STPs. Samples of surface water were collected in the summer and fall of 2000 at open-water sites in the lower Great Lakes (Lake Ontario and Lake Erie), at sites near the 2 STPs for the city of Windsor (ON, Canada), and at sites in Hamilton Harbor (ON, Canada), an embayment of western Lake Ontario that receives discharges from several STPs. In a follow-up study in the summer of 2002, samples of surface water and final effluent from adjacent STPs were collected from sites in Hamilton Harbor and Windsor. In addn., surface water and STP effluent samples were collected in Peterborough (ON, Canada). All samples of surface water and STP effluents were analyzed for selected acidic and neutral drugs. In the survey of Hamilton Harbor and Windsor conducted in 2000, acidic drugs and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were detected at ng/L concns. at sites that were up to 500 m away from the STP, but the hydrol. conditions of the receiving waters strongly influenced the spatial distribution of these compds. Drugs were not detected at open-water locations in western Lake Erie or in the Niagara River near the municipality of Niagara-on-the-Lake (ON, Canada). However, clofibric acid, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, and carbamazepine were detected in samples collected in the summer of 2000 at sites in Lake Ontario and at a site in the Niagara River (Fort Erie, ON, Canada) that were relatively remote from STP discharges. Follow-up studies in the summer of 2002 indicated that concns. of acidic and neutral drugs in surface waters near the point of sewage discharge into the Little River (ON, Canada) STP were approx. equal to the concns. in the final effluent from the STP. Caffeine and cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, were generally present in STP effluents and surface waters contaminated by drugs. The antidepressant fluoxetine and the antibiotic trimethoprom were also detected in most STP effluents and some surface water samples.

	abstract = {An approach is developed to obtain statistical properties similar to those of an infinite bulk system from computer simulations of a finite cluster. A rigorous theoretical formulation is given for the solvent boundary potential which takes the influence of the surrounding bulk into account. The solvent boundary potential is the configuration‐dependent solvation free energy of an effective cluster composed of an arbitrary solute and a finite number of explicit solvent molecules embedded inside a hard sphere of variable radius; the hard sphere does not act directly on the solute or the explicit solvent molecules, and its radius varies according to the instantaneous configurations. The formulation follows from an exact separation of the multidimensional configurational Boltzmann integral in terms of the solvent molecules nearest to the solute and the remaining bulk solvent molecules. An approximation to the solvent boundary potential is constructed for simulations of bulk water at constant pressure, including the influence of van der Waals and electrostaticinteractions. The approximation is illustrated with calculations of the solvation free energy of a water molecule and of sodium and potassiumions. The influence of bulk solvent on the conformational equilibrium of molecular solutes is illustrated by performing umbrella sampling calculations of n‐butane and alanine dipeptide in water. The boundary potential is tested to examine the dependence of the results on the number of water molecules included explicitly in the simulations. It is observed that bulk‐like results are obtained, even when only the waters in the first hydration shell are included explicitly.},

The calculations were done with the commonly used exchange-correlation functional B3LYP followed by a comprehensive analysis of the calculated highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied Kohn - Sham orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energies. The basis set dependence of the DFT results shows that the economical 6-31 +G* basis set is generally sufficient for calculating the HOMO and LUMO energies (if the calculated LUMO energies are negative) for use in correlating with molecular properties. The directly calculated ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), electronegativity ({\o}), hardness ({\`{e}}), and first electron excitation energy ({\^{o}}) are all in good agreement with the available experimental data. A generally applicable linear correlation relationship exists between the calculated HOMO energies and the experimental/calculated IPs. We have also found satisfactory linear correlation relationships between the calculated LUMO energies and experimental/calculated EAs (for the bound anionic states), between the calculated average HOMO/LUMO energies and {\o} values, between the calculated HOMO - LUMO energy gaps and {\`{e}} values, and between the calculated HOMO - LUMO energy gaps and experimental/ calculated first excitation energies. By using these linear correlation relationships, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energies can be employed to semiquantitatively estimate ionization potential, electron affinity, electronegativity, hardness, and first excitation energy.},

The effective fragment potential (EFP) method was used for the classical potential. Since EFP has a density dependent functional form, in contrast with most other MM potentials, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has been modified to combine TDDFT with EFP. This new method is then used to perform a hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation to generate a simulated spectrum of the n-->pi(*) vertical excitation energy of acetone in vacuum and with 100 water molecules. The calculated water solvent effect on the vertical excitation energy exhibits a blueshift of the n-->pi(*) vertical excitation energy in acetone (Delta omega(1)=0.211 eV), which is in good agreement with the experimental blueshift.},

In order to det. spatial and temporal variations in concns. of pharmaceuticals in the Tennessee River, water samples were collected from multiple points along the river and at the inflow of major tributaries.  Sampling structure was designed to study trends between surface and subsurface samples, seasonal trends (winter, spring, summer, and fall), the direct effect of sewage treatment plants (upstream vs. downstream), and the effect of downstream distance on pharmaceutical concns.  All samples were quantified via solid phase extn. followed by liq. chromatog.-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  This method yielded reproducible quantitation at low parts per trillion (ng/L) levels for all 14 analytes (acetaminophen, atorvastatin, caffeine, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, fluoxetine, levofloxacin, lovastatin, norfluoxetine, ranitidine, sertraline, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim).  Correlation analyses (depth, distance) and repeated-measures ANOVAs (season, sewage treatment plant proximity) were used to det. statistically significant trends for frequently detected pharmaceuticals (caffeine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole).  Caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were found to vary by season in subsurface samples; spring exhibited the highest concns.  Carbamazepine varied in proximity to sewage treatment plant outfall with subsurface samples yielding greater concns. downstream than upstream.  Individual pharmaceuticals displayed pos. correlation between surface and subsurface samples and neg. correlation with downstream distance from the headwaters. [on SciFinder(R)]},

The temporal variations and spatial extent of the plume and its effect on the presence of 39 pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants in the Vidy Bay were assessed over a 10 month period. A pronounced plume was observed from April to October, leading to locally elevated (up to 70-fold) pharmaceutical concentrations compared to the surrounding water column. For three of the measured substances, these plume-associated concentrations were sufficiently high to pose an ecotoxicological risk. The plume depth followed the thermal lake stratification, which moved to lower depths over the course of the warm seasons. Pharmaceutical hotspots associated with the plume were detected as far as 1.5 km downstream of the effluent wastewater outfall, but concentrations typically decreased with increasing distance from the wastewater outfall as a result of dilution and photodegradation. From November to January, when uniform temperature prevailed throughout the water column, no micropollutant plumes were detected. In contrast to pharmaceuticals, most pesticides showed homogeneous concentrations throughout the Vidy Bay during the whole study period, indicating that the effluent wastewater was not their dominant source. A strong linear correlation between electrical conductivity and concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants was identified. This relation will allow future estimates of wastewater-derived micropollutant concentrations via simple conductivity measurements.},

	abstract = {Using LR-TDDFT, we calculated the 0−0 energies of 15 small radicals for which the experimental values in gas phase are available. We used 17 functionals. It turned out that B3LYP, M06-2X, $\omega$B97X-D, CAM-B3LYP, and HSE06 functionals are the most effective functionals in terms of root-mean-square and average unsigned deviation. Using the standard value (0.47 a−0 1) of the attenuation parameter $\omega$, the long-range-corrected LC-GGA functionals give poor results. However, the LC-PBE with $\omega$ = 0.25 a−0 1 give a performance similar to that of B3LYP. Taking into account zero-point correction improves the results, but the contribution of adiabatic correction is more important than that due to the vibration. The vertical approximation is certainly not recommended. An adiabatic calculation seems to give a good compromise between computing time (and resources) and reliability of the results for most of molecules investigated in this work.},

Spatial hydration structures of aniline are examined along the liquid branch of the liquid-vapor coexistence curve of the simple point charge/extended water model at 298, 373, 473, and 573 K and in the supercritical region at 633, 733, and 833 K with density fixed at 0.3 g/cm(3). The coordination and H-bond numbers of aniline are calculated. The self-diffusion coefficient of aniline is also evaluated. At room temperature the solvation shell of aniline is comprised of approximately 32 water molecules. At 298 K, the amino group is hydrated by three water molecules with which it forms one strong and two weak (0.6) H bonds acting as an acceptor and donor, respectively. In addition, approximately 1.5 water molecules are identified as pi-coordinated, forming close to 0.75 H bonds with the aromatic ring of aniline. The features of the hydration shell structure of aniline diminish with temperature and decreasing density. The disappearance of pi-coordinated water molecules is noted at around 473 K, whereas the loss of the hydrophobic solvent cage is observed near the critical point of water. At supercritical conditions aniline is hydrated by approximately eight water molecules with the amino group coordinated to roughly two of them, forming less than one H bond in total.},

	abstract = {A model is presented for the electrostatic component of solvatochromic shifts on vertical electronic excitation energies. The model, called vertical electrostatic model 42 (VEM42), is based on representing the solute by a set of distributed atomic monopoles obtained by charge model 2 (CM2) and representing the solvent by its static and optical dielectric constants. The theory is applied here with intermediate neglect of differential overlap for spectroscopy–parameterization 2 (INDO/S2) configuration interaction wave functions. The model is implemented in the ZINDO electronic structure code package. We present illustrative applications to the singlet n → $\pi$∗ excitation of acetone in nine solvents. When the electrostatics are augmented by one-parameter estimates of dispersion and hydrogen-bonding contributions, the experimental solvatochromic shifts in the nine solvents are reproduced with a mean unsigned error of 65 cm−1 (0.2 kcal/mol). These calculations present a compelling picture of the quantitative origin of the solvatochromic red and blue shifts in this prototype n → $\pi$∗ excitation.},

Methods From Dec. 2007 to Dec. 2008, water samples were collected monthly (n = 12) from an upstream point, the effluent, four downstream points of the WWTP, and at the point where the river merges with the lake, and the concns. of ibuprofen, naproxen, bezafibrate, diclofenac, and ketoprofen were detd.  The anal. methodol. involved solid-phase extn. of the target compds. from water samples followed by liq. chromatog. coupled with tandem mass spectrometry for compd. sepn. and detection.  Results The studied pharmaceuticals were found in the effluent at concns. ranging from 31 to 1,852 ng l-1 depending on the season.  In the river and lake, the concns. were much lower (6-400 ng l-1) mainly due to diln. but also to a season-dependent contribution from natural transformation processes.  The mean mass flow of all analgesics was highest during winter while the highest mean mass flow of the lipid regulator bezafibrate was obsd. in spring.  Conclusions The WWTP is the main source of the target compds. in the aquatic environment.  The obsd. winter accumulation signifies the importance of natural transformation processes, which can only be estd. based on mass flow data, on the fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment.
